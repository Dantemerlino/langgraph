# System Analysis and Codebase Exploration Memory

This document serves as a memory log of analyses and codebase exploration performed by the AI agent.

## 1. Initial Codebase Exploration Summaries

This section summarizes the findings from the initial review of the project's codebase, prior to modifications made to `bigquery_tools.py`.

### `bigquery_tools.py` (Original State)
-   **Functionality**: Initially, this file provided placeholder functions that simulated interactions with Google BigQuery. It did not make actual calls to any BigQuery database.
-   **Key Functions**:
    -   `execute_sql_query(query: str)`: Simulated query execution. Returned hardcoded, canned results based on keywords found in the input `query` string (e.g., "capital", "schema", "orders").
    -   `get_table_schema(table_name: str)`: Simulated schema retrieval. Returned hardcoded schemas for a predefined list of tables.
    -   `list_tables(dataset_name: str)`: Simulated listing tables. Returned a consistent, hardcoded list of table names (`SIMULATED_TABLES = ["capitals_data", "schema_info", "order_summary", "customer_details"]`).
-   **Behavior**: The functions typically printed a message indicating they were simulating an action (e.g., "Simulating SQL query execution: ..."). The logic was based on simple string matching and did not involve actual database connections or query parsing.

### `Resident_caselog_code.ipynb`
-   **Purpose**: A Jupyter notebook designed as a complex data processing pipeline for ENT (Otorhinolaryngology) resident case logs.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Actual BigQuery Interaction**: Contained Python code that uses the `google-cloud-bigquery` library to connect to and query actual BigQuery databases.
    -   **SQL Queries**: Included several complex SQL queries. For instance, the `create_residents_from_bigquery` method queries `ml-mps-adl-intfhr-phi-p-3b6e.phi_current_fhir_us_p.PractitionerRole` and `ml-mps-adl-intudp-phi-p-d5cb.phi_udpwh_etl_us_p.DIM_HEALTHCARE_PROVIDER`. The `generate_query` method dynamically constructs a large SQL query joining multiple `FACT_` and `DIM_` tables within the `ml-mps-adl-intudp-phi-p-d5cb` project (specifically the `phi_udpwh_etl_us_p` dataset).
    -   **Google Cloud Services**: Demonstrated interaction with Google Cloud Storage for reading input files (Excel, JSON) and Google BigQuery for data retrieval.
    -   **Data Processing**: Showed pandas DataFrame manipulation for processing query results.
-   **Significance**: Provided concrete examples of how to connect to BigQuery, structure complex SQL queries for the "mayo" database environment, and process the results in Python. It highlighted target project IDs and dataset naming conventions.

### `Review_column_data.ipynb` (Initial Summary)
-   **Purpose**: An interactive Jupyter notebook tool for exploring data within specific columns of BigQuery tables.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Allowed users to select a database, table, and column via `ipywidgets`.
    -   Queried a central metadata table (`aif-usr-p-ent-ai-misc-3444.column_analysis.mayo_database_summary_table`) to populate selection options. This metadata table contains information like database names, table schemas, table names, column names, and data types.
    -   Dynamically generated and executed SQL queries to get value counts for the selected column (e.g., `SELECT \`{column_name}\` as value, COUNT(*) as count FROM \`{full_table_name}\` ...`).
    -   Displayed frequency distributions and allowed data export.
-   **Significance**: Showcased a method for dynamic schema discovery (via the metadata table) and how to analyze column content programmatically.

### `review_data_tables.ipynb`
-   **Purpose**: Similar to `Review_column_data.ipynb`, this notebook provides tools for exploring BigQuery tables.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Also queries the `mayo_database_summary_table` for metadata.
    -   Includes UI elements for selecting databases and tables.
    -   Demonstrates querying table metadata and fetching actual table data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM {full_table_name} LIMIT ...`).
-   **Significance**: Reinforced the patterns for metadata-driven exploration and direct table querying.

**General Note on Notebooks**: The Jupyter notebooks were instrumental in understanding the structure of the target BigQuery data, common query patterns, and the use of the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python client. They provided essential context for transitioning `bigquery_tools.py` from a simulated to a live environment.

## 2. Description of `mayo_structure_parsed.json`
-   **Purpose**: This JSON file acts as a local, pre-parsed representation of the schema for various BigQuery projects and datasets relevant to the "mayo" environment.
-   **Structure**:
    -   The top level consists of keys representing Google Cloud Project IDs (e.g., `ml-mps-adl-intudp-phi-p-d5cb`, `ml-mps-adl-intfhr-phi-p-3b6e`).
    -   Under each project ID, there is a `tables` object.
    -   The keys within `tables` are fully qualified table names in the format `dataset_id.table_name` (e.g., `phi_udpwh_etl_us_p.FACT_RADIOLOGY`).
    -   Each table entry contains a list of `columns`.
    -   Each column object specifies its `name`, `data_type`, `ordinal_position`, and sometimes a `description` and `unique_count`.
-   **Utility**:
    -   Serves as a schema cache for `bigquery_tools.py`, particularly for the `get_table_schema` and `list_tables` functions.
    -   Allows for quick lookups of table structures and column types without needing to make live calls to BigQuery's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, which can be faster and avoid query costs associated with metadata lookups.
    -   Provides descriptive information about columns where available.

## 3. Detailed Evaluation of `Review_column_data.ipynb`

This notebook is an interactive tool designed for data exploration within Google BigQuery, focusing on understanding the distribution of values within individual columns.

*   **Purpose**:
    The primary goal of `Review_column_data.ipynb` is to allow a user (typically a data analyst or developer) to select a specific database, table, and column, and then view a frequency distribution of the values within that column. This helps in understanding data cardinality, identifying common or unexpected values, and assessing data quality.

*   **Code Structure and Functionality**:
    1.  **Setup & Authentication**: Includes cells for Python environment setup, dependency installation (`requirements.txt`), and Google Cloud authentication using `gcloud auth application-default login`.
    2.  **BigQuery Client**: Initializes a `bigquery.Client` for database interactions.
    3.  **Metadata Querying**:
        *   It fetches initial metadata (database names, table schemas, column names, data types) from a pre-compiled summary table: `aif-usr-p-ent-ai-misc-3444.column_analysis.mayo_database_summary_table`.
        *   This metadata populates `ipywidgets` like dropdowns, enabling an interactive selection process.
    4.  **Interactive UI (`ipywidgets`)**:
        *   Provides widgets for searching and selecting columns.
        *   Includes a slider (`result_limit_slider`) to control the number of top values to retrieve for download and a checkbox (`no_limit_checkbox`) to download all unique values.
        *   Features a "Get Column Values" button to trigger analysis and separate "Download CSV/Excel" buttons.
        *   A "Table Summary Explorer" tab was also noted, extending this to summarize all columns in a table.
    5.  **Dynamic SQL Query Generation**: Based on user selections, it constructs SQL queries. The core query for value frequency is:
        ```sql
        SELECT
            `{column_name}` AS value,
            COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM
            `{database_name}.{table_schema}.{table_name}`
        GROUP BY
            `{column_name}`
        ORDER BY
            count DESC
        LIMIT {limit} -- (or no limit)
        ```
    6.  **Results Display and Export**:
        *   Displays the top N (usually 20) most frequent values and their counts in an HTML table.
        *   Allows exporting the (potentially larger) queried dataset to CSV or Excel.

*   **SQL Queries Produced (Examples)**:
    *   **Metadata Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT DISTINCT database_name, table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type
        FROM `aif-usr-p-ent-ai-misc-3444.column_analysis.mayo_database_summary_table`
        ORDER BY table_name, column_name
        ```
    *   **Value Frequency Query** (e.g., for `PATIENT_DK` in `FACT_ENCOUNTERS`):
        ```sql
        SELECT `PATIENT_DK` AS value, COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM `ml-mps-adl-intudp-phi-p-d5cb.phi_udpwh_etl_us_p.FACT_ENCOUNTERS`
        GROUP BY `PATIENT_DK`
        ORDER BY count DESC
        LIMIT 100
        ```

*   **Insights Provided by the Notebook**:
    *   **Data Distribution & Cardinality**: Reveals common values, frequency of NULLs (if represented), and the number of unique values in a column.
    *   **Data Quality Assessment**: Helps identify anomalies, inconsistencies, or unexpected patterns in column data.
    *   **Schema Navigation**: Acts as a basic schema browser through its interactive selections based on the `mayo_database_summary_table`.
    *   **Understanding Column Content**: Provides direct insight into the typical data a column holds, beyond just its data type.

*   **Potential Utility for Agents**:
    1.  **Dynamic Schema/Data Exploration**: The agentic system could adapt the notebook's strategy:
        *   Query a central metadata table for schema details if `mayo_structure_parsed.json` is incomplete or potentially stale.
    2.  **Informing Query Generation (Value-Based Prompt Augmentation)**:
        *   Knowledge of common values in a column can significantly improve SQL generation from natural language. If a user query mentions "Cardiology", the agent can verify if "Cardiology" is a common value in a `department_name` column or if a variant like "Cardiology Services" should be used.
        *   This information (top N values, data type, cardinality) can be added to LLM prompts for more accurate SQL.
    3.  **New Tool for Agents**:
        *   The core logic could be encapsulated into a new function in `bigquery_tools.py` (e.g., `get_column_value_distribution(table_name, column_name, n_top_values=10)`).
        *   The `retrieve_data_agent` could use this tool to "preview" column data characteristics, aiding in query formulation (especially for `WHERE` clauses) or result interpretation.
    4.  **Query Validation & Refinement**:
        *   If an agent-generated query yields no results, this value distribution information can help diagnose if incorrect filter values were used.
    5.  **Improving Answer Generation**: Understanding the distribution of key data points can help the `generate_answer_agent` provide more contextually rich summaries.

**Conclusion on `Review_column_data.ipynb`**: While an interactive tool for human users, its data exploration patterns and SQL logic for analyzing column value frequencies are highly valuable. Adapting this logic can empower AI agents to better understand database content, generate more precise SQL queries, and validate their assumptions about the data.
